# ProDFace
Web-tool for the analysis of Protein-DNA structures (experimental, models, MD snapshots, docked structures etc.)

INTRODUCTION
ProDFace is a web tool that characterizes the binding region of a protein-DNA complex based on amino acid propensity, hydrogen bond (HB) donor capacity (number of solvent accessible HB donor groups), sequence conservation at the interface core and rim region, and geometry. The program takes as input the structure of a protein-DNA complex in PDB (Protein Data Bank) format, and outputs various physicochemical and geometric parameters of the interface, as well as conservation of the interface residues in the protein component.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
This is the web-tool version of ProDFace which has been tested in Chrome, Firefox and Edge. However, Java plug-ins should be pre-installed to display Java applets properly. The stand alone version of the program will be released in the next update of ProDFace.
